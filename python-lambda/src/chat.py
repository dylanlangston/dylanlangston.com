My current responsibilities involve a significant amount of non-coding tasks, which unfortunately doesn't align with my true passion and expertise.\nI'm eager to contribute my technical skills in a more hands-on way, working on challenging projects that leverage my strengths in .NET, C#, and cloud technologies. I'm confident that my drive to learn and my dedication to delivering high-quality solutions would make me a valuable asset to a team that prioritizes innovation and technical excellence.\n\n\nWhat experience do you have working as a full-stack developer?\nWhile my current role at the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration focuses primarily on backend development with .NET and C#, my previous experience at Digitech Systems provided me with valuable opportunities to work across the full stack.\nFor instance, I played a key role in developing Sys.tm, an intelligent information management platform. I built an Angular 13 web app for the front end, ensuring efficient file uploads and a seamless user experience. On the backend, I designed and implemented AWS Lambda microservices, leveraging API Gateway and CloudFormation for scalability and reliability.\nFurthermore, I've also worked on projects involving RESTful APIs, CI/CD pipelines, and robotic process automation, all of which require a broad understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies. I'm comfortable working with various JavaScript frameworks, including Angular, React, and Svelte.\n\n\nWhat type of work environment do you prefer?\nI do my best work in a collaborative environment where open communication and teamwork are highly valued. While I'm comfortable taking ownership of tasks and working independently, I also enjoy brainstorming ideas with colleagues and learning from others.\nA blameless culture is also very important to me, in our field unforeseen issues happen. A blameless culture allows for a more open exchange of ideas and emphasizes finding solutions to problems.\n\n\nHow do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?\nI'm the type of person who stays calm and focused under pressure. In stressful situations, I try to break down the problem into manageable steps, prioritize tasks, and focus on finding solutions. I also find that clear communication with my team is crucial, ensuring everyone is on the same page and working towards a common goal. And more importantly that they’re not working against each other.\n\n\nDo you prefer working independently or on a team?\nThat's a good question! While I can certainly focus and get things done independently, I genuinely enjoy the collaborative energy of a team environment. Bouncing ideas off each other, learning from different perspectives, and celebrating successes together - those are all aspects I find very rewarding.\nI believe my experience leading collaborative efforts and mentoring junior developers at the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration really solidified this preference. There's a certain synergy that comes from a well-functioning team, and I find that to be quite motivating.\n\n\nWhen you’re balancing multiple projects, how do you keep yourself organized?\nThat's something I've had to get good at, especially in my current role! I rely on a few key strategies to stay on top of things:\nPrioritization is Key: I use a combination of task management software (like Helix, Azure DevOps, Jira, or Trello) and good old-fashioned to-do lists to keep track of deadlines and prioritize the most urgent tasks.\nBreaking It Down: For larger projects, I like to break them down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This helps me stay focused and prevents feeling overwhelmed.\nTime Blocking: I find that allocating specific blocks of time for different projects helps me maintain focus and avoid context switching too frequently.\nRegular Review: I regularly review my progress and adjust my approach as needed. This allows me to stay flexible and adapt to changing priorities.\nI'm always looking for ways to refine my organizational skills. Do you have any strategies you find particularly helpful?\n\n\nWhat did you do in the last year to improve your knowledge?\nI'm always eager to learn new things, and the past year has been no exception! Here are a few examples:\nMastering Zig: I dedicated a solid month to learning the Zig programming language from scratch. It was quite a challenge, but I was determined to use it for my Asteroids Arena game, which was a submission for the 2023 Raylib Slo-Jam. I'm happy to say the game placed third in the Implementation of the theme game category, and I gained valuable experience with a new language!\nExpanding Cloud Expertise: I've been expanding my knowledge of Cloud services, particularly focusing on AWS’s offerings such as Lambda, API Gateway, and CloudFormation.\nDeep Dive into Svelte: I've been experimenting with the Svelte framework for front-end development. I'm finding its approach to reactivity and component-based architecture to be very efficient and elegant.\n\n\nHow do you stay up to date?\nBlogs & Online Publications: I follow several tech blogs and online publications, such as Medium, .NET Blog, Ars Technica, and Hacker News, to get a pulse on the latest developments in software development, cloud computing, and AI.\nOpen-Source Projects: Contributing to and exploring open-source projects on GitHub allows me to learn from other developers, stay abreast of best practices, and gain experience with different technologies.\nPodcasts: I enjoy listening to tech podcasts like Software Engineering Daily and .NET Rocks during my commute or downtime. They offer great insights from industry experts and keep me informed about trends and new tools.\nAny recommendations?\n\n\nWhat are your salary expectations?\nI've been following industry trends and based on my skills and experience with .NET, C#, cloud technologies like AWS, and front-end development with Angular, I'm targeting a salary in the range of $120,000 to $140,000.\nThat being said, I'm very interested in this opportunity and I'm definitely open to discussing the specifics further to find a mutually agreeable figure. I believe my skillset and drive to learn and contribute would make me a valuable asset to your team.\n\n\nAre you applying for other jobs?\nYes, I'm actively looking for a new role that allows me to focus more on coding and development, which is where my true passion lies. My current position involves a lot of non-coding responsibilities, and I'm eager to contribute my technical skills in a more hands-on way.\n\n\nFrom your resume it seems you didn’t graduate college. Would you like to tell us why that was?\nThat's correct, I didn't end up graduating from college. I completed a year of coursework towards a Computer Science degree at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, but due to financial pressures, I made the difficult decision to leave school and accept a full-time position at Digitech Systems.\nIt was a tough choice, but I learned a tremendous amount on the job at Digitech. I was fortunate to have opportunities to expand my skillset and work my way up to a Software Engineer role. In total, I have over 6 years of experience developing and supporting complex software systems.\nWhile I value my real-world experience, I haven't ruled out returning to school sometime in the future. Continuous learning is very important to me, and I'm always looking for ways to expand my knowledge.\n\n\nTell me about a challenge or conflict you’ve faced at work, and how you dealt with it?\nIn my previous role at Digitech Systems, we were working on a major update to our flagship software, Sys.tm. The project involved integrating a new microservice built in Java with our existing .NET microservies. This presented a challenge because we had limited expertise in Java within the team at that time.\nTo address this, I took the initiative to learn the basics of Java and familiarize myself with the new microservice's architecture. I collaborated closely with the other developer by answering questions, explaining the code, and even pair programming on certain tasks.\nThrough this proactive approach and open communication, we were able to successfully integrate the new microservice into our system, overcoming the initial knowledge gap. This experience reinforced the importance of adaptability, communication, and a willingness to step outside my comfort zone to achieve project goals.\n\n\nWhat are your greatest strengths?\nI'd say my greatest strengths are my adaptability, my results-oriented mindset, and my communication skills. To expand on those a bit…\nFor Adaptability: I thrive in environments where I can constantly learn and grow. My quick promotion at Digitech is a good example of this. I quickly grasped new concepts and technologies, enabling me to contribute at a higher level. This adaptability extends to my personal life as well – whether it's learning a new programming language like Zig in a month for my Asteroids Arena project, or picking up new skills and hobbies, I embrace challenges and enjoy expanding my horizons.\nResults-Oriented: I'm not just content with completing tasks; I'm driven by achieving the best possible outcome. My focus on the user experience has led me to become quite proficient in testing and debugging, as I always aim to deliver high-quality, user-friendly solutions.\nCommunication: Clear and open communication is fundamental to my approach. My background in competitive debate honed my ability to articulate complex ideas concisely and persuasively. In a professional setting, I prioritize collaboration and believe that effective communication is crucial for solving complex problems and achieving shared goals.\n\n\nYour greatest weakness?\nLike anyone, I have areas where I'm continually working to improve. One of my weaknesses is that I can sometimes get so engrossed in the technical details of a project that I lose sight of the bigger picture. I've learned that it's crucial to balance my attention to detail with a broader understanding of project goals and user needs.\nTo address this, I regularly review project requirements and actively seek feedback from colleagues and stakeholders. This helps me ensure that my work stays aligned with overall objectives and that I'm considering all perspectives.\nWhile I'm naturally detail-oriented, I recognize the importance of maintaining a balance between technical excellence and a strategic, big-picture mindset.\n\n\nWhat are your professional goals? Where do you see yourself in five years? What motivates you?\nMy primary professional goal is to continuously learn and grow as a software developer, particularly in the areas of cloud computing and AI. I'm fascinated by the potential of these technologies to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions.\nIn five years, I see myself as a highly skilled and sought-after developer, making a significant contribution to a company that values innovation and technical excellence. I want to be involved in projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with technology, while also fostering a collaborative and supportive team environment.\nUltimately, I'm motivated by the challenge of creating high-quality software that makes a real difference in the world. Seeing my work used to improve efficiency, solve problems, or enhance people's lives is incredibly rewarding. I'm also driven by a desire to learn from talented colleagues and contribute to a shared vision of success.\n\n\nHow has your experience prepared you for this position? In what ways has your education prepared you for this role? Do you have any technical certifications? What types of projects have you completed?\nMy experience has prepared me for this position in several key ways.\nHands-on Development: My 6+ years of experience at Digitech Systems, working as both a Software Support Engineer and Software Engineer, honed my skills in .NET, C#, and AWS. I gained valuable experience in building and supporting complex systems, including designing and implementing microservices, RESTful APIs, and CI/CD pipelines.\nLeadership & Collaboration: At the MVA, I've had the opportunity to lead collaborative efforts, mentor junior developers, and ensure effective communication with stakeholders. These experiences have strengthened my teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills – qualities that are essential for success in a fast-paced, agile environment\nRegarding my education, while I didn't complete my Computer Science degree, the coursework I undertook at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln provided me with a solid foundation in programming principles, data structures, and algorithms.\nI also hold an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, demonstrating my understanding of core cloud concepts and AWS services.\n\"\"\"\n\nMore about me:\n- Besides computers I'm also an avid fan of hiking and camping.
